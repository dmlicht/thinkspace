First comes first, [Find Action By Name](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/navigating-to-action.html) is your new best friend (`⇧⌘A`). If you think there is a function Intellij should have, there is a good chance that it does. **Search Commands** is the quickest way to find and use it. It will also show you the shortcut to quickly jot down and commit to memory.

* `⌘,` opens up preferences, which you can quickly search through by typing
* `⌘;` opens up project preferences

Like using vim bindings? Download [IdeaVim plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim), it doesn’t clobber any of the important default shortcuts.
